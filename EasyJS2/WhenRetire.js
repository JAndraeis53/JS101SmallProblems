/*
Build a program that logs when the user will retire and how many more years the user has to work until retirement.

Example:
What is your age? 30
At what age would you like to retire? 70

It's 2017. You will retire in 2057.
You have only 40 years of work to go!


answer:
let readlineSync = require("readline-sync");

let currentAge = Number(readlineSync.question("What is your age?\n"));
let retirementAge = Number(
  readlineSync.question("At what age would you like to retire?\n")
);

let today = new Date();

let currentYear = today.getFullYear();

let workYearsToGo = retirementAge - currentAge;
let retirementYear = currentYear + workYearsToGo;

console.log(`It's ${currentYear}. You will retire in ${retirementYear}. `);
console.log(`You have only ${workYearsToGo} years of work to go!`);
